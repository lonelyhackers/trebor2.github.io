Hi.

An exoskeleton is a wearable robot. They give us more control, and more choice, in life. If a computer augments our intellectual ability, an exoskeleton will augment our physicality. 

They will make us more efficient, more resilient and robust, and more equal. Social mobility eludes those who are immobile – paralyzed, elderly, luckless. The vulnerable and forgotten will have the choice of participation, with exoskeletons. 

I don’t think the utility of exoskeletons is to make me run like Bolt, punch like Ali, or swim like Phelps. Exoskeletons will protect who I already am: I can run a marathon every day of my life, knowing my joints won't degrade, with exoskeletons. And they will still let me choose who I want to become. I can condition my joints, muscles, and gait, every minute of the day, with my exoskeleton. Physical therapy begone, bygone. 

Exoskeletons will give everyone the choice to live and move as we already do, while preserving and empowering our mobility.

This is Modern Mobility. Augmented reality isn't something you'll wear around your head, but under your clothes. The exoskeleton is the true wearable. 

This archive begins with my first exoskeleton, Atlas, when I am 15. We conclude with Awstrol, it’s spiritual successor, when I am 18. <r8>I have only ever wanted to make tools that empower individuals to be universal.</r8> 

I have not included all my work in the interim, only those that seem significant, that show learning, or which I simply have affection.
