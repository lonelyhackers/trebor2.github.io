This is an archive with very few words.
It is about designs, their physical nature, and how they were made. 
This isn’t about me, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of my work that, ironically, describes who I am. It describes how I work, my values, my preoccupations, and my goals. I’ve always hoped to be defined by what I do rather than by what I say. 
The actual creations are, of course, incontrovertible. I have attempted to develop an approach to representing them that is impartial. The photography is analytical and spare, free from personal voice and its consequent subjectivity wherever possible. 
This archive begins with Atlas, when I am 15, and we conclude with Awstrol, it’s spiritual successor, when I am 18. I have not included all my work in the interim, only those that seem significant, that demonstrate learning, or which I simply have affection. 
The decision to stop somewhere, to not include current work, and to not reveal future designs, was fantastically hard. These designs of mine, they come after hundreds of interviews I have conducted over the years. I have shared with people who suffer from paralysis, old age, disabling injuries, mental illness, gender discrimination or gender incongruence, and they have shared with me. We differ in all the tiny ways, but are the same in all the major ones. Our stories are more alike, than unlike, whether my childhood OCD, or something more tangible. My creations are the result of a profoundly close collaboration between many different groups. We behave as one team with a singular goal; how we work enables what we make. 
Designing and making are inseparable. Seeing something made, you appreciate its nature. Understanding the remarkable transformation of anonymous materials into recognizable products, you begin to understand that we don't arbitrarily create form. Fundamental ideas and shapes are derived directly from our knowledge of materials and manufacturing process: bending a single piece of aluminum to make a stand or cutting a hole to create a handle rather than adding multiple parts. 
We attempt to develop form that achieves integrity between external surfaces and internal components. Look at the first iMac. So much of the form was developed to be coherent and harmonious with the primary internal component, the cathode ray tube. You can see how forms and material have evolved, driven by display technologoies and components, as we transitioned from spherical cathode ray tubes to flat-panel liquid crystal displays. 
We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative. 
Although we have been doing this for many years, creating something simple never seems to get any easier. Simplicity is not the absence of complexity. Just removing clutter would result in an uncomplicated but meaningless product. I think a product that is truly simple somehow communicates, with striking clarity, what it is and what it can do. 
Above all, I have come to feel sure that human beings sense care in the same way we sense carelessness. I do think we respond, maybe not consciously, to something much bigger than the object. We sense the group of people behind the products, people who do more than make something work, people who sincerely care about the smallest unseen details, as well as the big idea and primary function.
