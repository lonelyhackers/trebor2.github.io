<h6>While metals are great, they're actually a poor choice for exoskeletons. I experimented with designs using <a href="https://markforged.com/" target="_blank">3d printed carbon fiber</a> as the primary material, and metals in areas where 3d printing wasn't feasible - components under constant and high strains, or  that needed very high tolerances, or were too large to print. In this render, you can see an exploded view of a brushless dc hub motor. The top clamshell is magnesium, while the rest of the chassis would use 3d printed carbon fiber.</h6>
<a href="/assets/legcomp.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/legcomp.jpg)</a>
<h6>The new motor approach was essentially inverting the layout of the old design. This 'hub' type motor could be smaller (5 in. diameter instead of 6), lighter (2 pounds versus 3), and stronger. It took a while for the design to mature into a robust form, which you'll see below.</h6>
<a href="/assets/legcomp1.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/legcomp1.jpg)</a>
<h6>The primary differences are quite apparent. Everything in black is 3d printed carbon fiber, and the gold is magnesium. The new construction method was cheaper and ergonomically superior, although probably not as robust. It took along time to reach a design that was adequately robust, while retaining all the advantages of this new design architecture.</h6>
<a href="/assets/legcomp2.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/legcomp2.jpg)</a>
<h6>The new, inverted motor architecture was also far slimmer by virtue that the entire outer shell rotated, instead of an inner spoke which would have to project above the motor. Another advantage of 3D printing is that you could embed components within the chassis - instead of using screws and bolts. This allowed for simpler, unibody assemblies that were inherently superior to past methods.</h6>
<a href="/assets/untitled.72.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/untitled.72.jpg)</a>
<h6>Version 10 kept the familiar power supply monolith and pelvis structure. It did introduce a new approach to the foot piece, however. Past designs were ergonomically insufficient (and too expensive). This new approach put the foot piece inside the users shoe instead. V10's experimental ankle/foot design wasn't very well thought out though, and was fixed later.</h6>
<a href="/assets/v5.59.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/v5.59.jpg)</a>
<h6>The pelvis used to involve 20 unique components. 3D printing allowed the main structure to exist as a single piece instead. Note, the internals of the pelvis are absent. </h6>
<a href="/assets/v5.62.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/v5.62.jpg)</a>
<h6>The monolith contained a battery pack design similar to a tesla - lots of small, cylindrical cells wired together. The total power of this pack was ~1200 watts - future designs sought to avoid the safety danger that one giant lithium battery grenade poses (although it was also an ergonomic priority.) Behind the batteries were control electronics and sensors.</h6>
<a href="/assets/untitled.92.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/untitled.92.jpg)</a>
<h6>Version 11 focused on improving user usability - the two primary improvements were the additions of ultrasonic rangefinders and a passive flexure joint foot. Ultrasonic rangefinders are like laser rangefinders, except they bounce sound off objects instead of light. By placing the rangefinders on the hip joint and lower ankle (they're the small black surfaces), you can produce a wireframe map of the forward environment, in real time. This allows for essentially a ‘smart’ exoskeleton that can respond to external stimulus without user intervention.</h6>
<a href="/assets/croprightfinale.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/croprightfinale.jpg)</a>
<h6>The foot was based on a similar principle to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics_of_Oscar_Pistorius'_running_blades
" target="_blank">Oscar Pistorious's running blades</a> - it uses 3d printed carbon fiber, and would bend as the user pressed into it while 'toeing-off', storing energy as it bended, and releasing it after a certain point, essentially the same motion as a normal ankle/foot movement, in a simple, reliable package. In robotics, this is known as an <a href="http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/underactuated.html" target="_blank">underactuated joint</a>.</h6>
<a href="/assets/motoradsc.png" target="blank">![](/assets/motoradsc.png)</a>
<h6>Embedded 3D printing allowed for otherwise impossible motor designs and specs. There are only 3 components in this motor - the 3d printed chassis, with the stator and bearing embedded during printing. This motor is 5 inches in diameter, and would fit comfortably in the palm of your hand. It weighed around a pound. </h6>
<a href="/assets/yellowmotorcrop.jpg" target="blank">![](/assets/yellowmotorcrop.jpg)</a>
<h6>The same motor in a hip assembly. This featured a waterproof distance sensor (the large black cylinder), enhanced joint sizing mechanism, weighed approximately 2.5 pounds, and would cost ~$250. The channels on the rubber pad are for routing cables from the lower leg assembly upwards.</h6>
<a href="/assets/crop5.5test.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/crop5.5test.jpg)</a>
<h6>The monolith approach was superseded by a four-part butterfly assembly. This early revision shows only the central hub, containing critical electronics and sensors. The upper restraints prevented the user from leaning too far forward, and wouldn’t touch the user in normal usage.</h6>
<a href="/assets/finale.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/finale.jpg)</a>
<h6>The final V12 design. The ‘butterfly’ assembly established a center of mass in line with the users center of mass, and provided users greater flexibility adjusting to their body size. It had ~900 watts of power, and probably would’ve provided a six-hour endurance. </h6>
<a href="assets/psusnapcrop.PNG" target="_blank">![](/assets/psusnapcrop.PNG)</a>
<h6>The butterfly utilized a hybrid assembly – a 3d printed fiberglass chassis, with aluminum reinforcement inserts – to reduce costs and weight. The entire assembly weighed 8.5 pounds, and would’ve cost ~$2,500 – roughly a third of the entire exoskeleton cost. This screencap shows the unfinished assembly in CAD.</h6>
<a href="/assets/finale.5.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/finale.5.jpg)</a>
<h6>A user probably could’ve donned the entire system alone in less than five minutes, while in their wheelchair. V12 weighed 25 pounds, and the entire weight would transfer through the ground, not onto the user. It pushed 3D printing, motor design, and construction methodology to their max, without achieving an ergonomic coup - exoskeletons need to fit humans flawlessly, to be used by them. So V12 was the final ‘Atlas’, and V13 - Awstrol - was born in March, 2016.</h6>
