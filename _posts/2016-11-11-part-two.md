<h6>Metals are too rigid for an ergonomic exoskeleton. I explored using <a href="https://markforged.com/" target="_blank">3d printed carbon fiber</a> as the primary construction material. Everything in black is 3d printed carbon fiber, and the gold is magnesium.</h6>
<a href="/assets/legcomp1.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/legcomp1.jpg)</a>
<h6>Printing opened a world of unexplored shapes. Features that once required complex assemblies used printed unibody parts instead. The print pauses to embed sensors or bearings, for example, in hollow cavities within the part. These become 'embedded' inside as the print continues. A chassis consisting of unibody parts, with embedded sub-components, is light and cheap. The leg on the left uses a quarter the number of parts as the right one.</h6>
<a href="/assets/legcomp.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/legcomp.jpg)</a>
<h6>So much of the form was developed to be coherent and harmonious with the primary internal component, the motor. You can see how forms and material have evolved, driven by material and manufacturing advances, as we transitioned from inward facing motors to outward facing 'hub' motors.</h6>
<a href="/assets/detailedmotor.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/detailedmotor.jpg)</a>
<h6>3D printed hub motors enabled lighter and slimmer assemblies. They are, without a doubt, the best option for motor driven designs.</h6>
<a href="/assets/v5.59.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/v5.59.jpg)</a>
<h6>The pelvis used to involve 20 unique components. 3D printing allowed the main structure to exist as a single piece instead. Note, the internals of the pelvis are absent.</h6>
<a href="/assets/untitled.72.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/untitled.72.jpg)</a>
<h6>Version 10 experimented with feet. Feet should be feet, not metal planks. Feet should appear delightful, and communicate warmth, exuberant accommodation, and intention. The theory was sound, but the penguin design, while undeniably cute, was terrible. Proper implementation required months of further experimentation.</h6>
<a href="/assets/legblade.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/legblade.jpg)</a>
<h6>The result was a design similar in principle to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics_of_Oscar_Pistorius'_running_blades
" target="_blank">Oscar Pistorius’s running blades</a>. The knee would rotate while being lifted by the hip, which would push the users foot against the carbon fiber foot. As their ankle rotated, the curved piece would flex, storing energy throughout, then releasing it after a certain point, exerting a force against the floor, and, in effect, mirroring the kinematics of normal ankle movement. Designing a passive, lightweight mechanism – that ended up looking like a normal foot – that was ergonomically intuitive and reliable was probably the most rewarding and influential engineering challenge I’ve faced.</h6>
<a href="/assets/untitled.92.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/untitled.92.jpg)</a>
<h6>Exoskeletons should see, so users can relax and enjoy the view. So, a system similar in principal to how AI cars ‘see’ was designed. The two black surfaces on the hip and ankle are ultrasonic rangefinders - like laser rangefinders (a.k.a. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar" target="_blank">LIDAR</a>), except they use sound instead of light. This allows for essentially a ‘smart’ exoskeleton that can respond to external stimulus without user intervention, much like a normal person passively navigates a crowd.</h6>
<a href="/assets/motoradsc.png" target="blank">![](/assets/motoradsc.png)</a>
<h6>The original hub design had serious heat, speed, and reliability issues. Longevity simulations predicted failure after a few months with users above 110 pounds. A tenable design came after a year of experimenting in Matlab and several other programs. In practice, the coils would be <a href="http://www.magicall.biz/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/potting-03.jpg" target="_blank">‘potted’</a> with an epoxy resin to waterproof and redirect heat efficiently. </h6>
<a href="/assets/yellowmotorcrop.jpg" target="blank">![](/assets/yellowmotorcrop.jpg)</a>
<h6>The hub remained 5 inches in diameter, 1.25 inches tall, and weighed about a pound. It cost ~$200, and would fit in your palm. This hip assembly was the final revision from the V12 series (the assemblies below show earlier, less robust designs). The channels on the rubber pad are for routing cables from the lower leg assembly upwards.</h6>
<a href="/assets/butterflyv12crop.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/butterflyv12crop.jpg)</a>
<h6>The monolith approach was superseded by a four-part butterfly assembly. This early design shows only the central hub, which would contain critical electronics and sensors. The upper restraints prevented the user from leaning too far forward, but wouldn’t touch the user otherwise.</h6>
<a href="/assets/finale.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/finale.jpg)</a>
<h6>The final V12 design. The ‘butterfly’ assembly restored Atlas's center of mass to the 'goldilocks region', and drastically improved ergonomics (although it was still ergonomically untenable, it was an improvement). V12 weighed 25 pounds (no weight would rest on the user - it would all transfer into the ground), had ~900 watts of power, and probably would’ve provided a six-hour endurance.</h6>
<a href="assets/psusnapcrop.PNG" target="_blank">![](/assets/psusnapcrop.PNG)</a>
<h6>The butterfly utilized a hybrid assembly – a 3d printed fiberglass chassis, with aluminum reinforcement inserts – to minimize costs and weight. The entire assembly weighed 8.5 pounds, and would’ve cost ~$2,500 – roughly a third of the entire exoskeleton cost. Later revisions would've hopefully improved ergonomics and cost. This screencap shows the unfinished assembly in CAD.</h6>
<a href="/assets/finale.5.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/finale.5.jpg)</a>
<h6>V12 pushed conventional design notions to their max, but try visualizing walking with it. For me, the result is awkward, robotic, and constrained. We're humans. We have bends and curves. We twist and flex. Motion is dynamic; unplanned; improvised. And V12 - Atlas - is none of those things. So, V12 was the final ‘Atlas’, and V13 was born in March, 2016, to another name: Awstrol.</h6>

<h6>The decision to kill three years of research was fantastically hard. I debated for two months, before deciding that a ‘human’ exoskeleton was probably possible, and necessary, if I wanted to create something new, and of consequence. I made these videos with Matlab – it tracks the subjects motion, and center of mass. It's important because it shows us how humans balance: if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wolPuHKrX9o&feature=youtu.be&t=36m50s" target="_blank">Mykayla Skinner's</a> center of mass extends beyond the hatched lines while near stationary, she waiver's, and will fall if she can't respond fast enough. The fundamental nature of balancing is the same for everyone, no matter on a beam or climbing stairs. <r8>A 'human' exoskeleton has to be able to do ballet.</r8></h6>

<h6>My theory is, that with enough video samples, you can 'train' a computer to walk and balance dynamically in chaotic environments, like humans do - this is called 'deep-learning' (<a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2016/03/deep-learning-for-robots-learning-from.html" target="_blank">read more here.</a>) Instead of 'building' our own realistic gait algorithm, which is probably impossible (given the lack of progress over the past decade...), you could instead train neural networks with many different body types using this analysis, and provide users quasi-personalized and adaptable gaits. The network would continue to learn and mature throughout operation with the user.</h6>

<h6>In essence, the machine and human will become indistinguishable. The potential is huge - think AI cars. This fusion of biology and purposeful design is what I mean when I say an exoskeleton must be human: if users live and move like normal people, they become normal - not paralyzed or disabled or unlucky. This is essentially the direction Awstrol has been heading - it's a totally different animal, and paralysis is the smallest thing it might solve. Read on for more about Awstrol.
