<h6>Metals are too rigid for an ergonomic exoskeleton. I explored using <a href="https://markforged.com/" target="_blank">3d printed carbon fiber</a> as the primary construction material. Everything in black is 3d printed carbon fiber, and the gold is magnesium.</h6>
<a href="/assets/legcomp1.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/legcomp1.jpg)</a>
<h6>Printing opened a world of unexplored shapes. Features that once required complex assemblies used printed unibody parts instead. The print pauses to embed sensors or bearings, for example, in hollow cavities within the part. These become 'embedded' inside as the print continues. A chassis consisting of unibody parts, with embedded sub-components, is light and cheap. The joint connecting the hip and knee on the left, uses a quarter the number of parts as the other one.</h6>
<a href="/assets/legcomp.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/legcomp.jpg)</a>
<h6>So much of the form was developed to be coherent and harmonious with the primary internal component, the motor. You can see how forms and material have evolved, driven by material and manufacturing advances, as we transitioned from inward facing motors to outward facing, hub motors.</h6>

<h6>Test</h6>

<h6>Version 10 also introduced a new approach to the foot piece. Past designs were ergonomically insufficient (and too expensive). This new approach put the foot piece inside the user’s shoe instead. V10's experimental ankle/foot design wasn't very well thought out though, and was heavily iterated on.</h6>
<a href="/assets/v5.59.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/v5.59.jpg)</a>
<h6>The pelvis used to involve 20 unique components. 3D printing allowed the main structure to exist as a single piece instead. Note, the internals of the pelvis are absent. </h6>
<a href="/assets/v5.62.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/v5.62.jpg)</a>
<h6>The monolith contained a battery pack design like a Tesla’s - lots of small, cylindrical cells wired together. The total power of this pack was ~1200 watts - future designs sought to avoid the safety danger that one giant lithium battery grenade poses (although it was also an ergonomic priority.) Behind the batteries were control electronics and sensors.</h6>
<a href="/assets/untitled.92.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/untitled.92.jpg)</a>
<h6>Version 11 focused on usability - Atlas became 'smart' and 'aware', and more human in its form. The two black surfaces on the hip and ankle are ultrasonic rangefinders - like laser rangefinders (a.k.a. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar" target="_blank">LIDAR</a>), except they use sound instead of light. By placing these on articulating joints - the hip and ankle - you can map the user’s forward environment in real time, a similar process to autonomous cars. This allows for essentially a ‘smart’ exoskeleton that can respond to external stimulus without user intervention, much like a normal person passively navigates a crowd.</h6>
<a href="/assets/croprightfinale.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/croprightfinale.jpg)</a>
<h6>Atlas became more human in form with a new foot design, similar in principle to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics_of_Oscar_Pistorius'_running_blades
" target="_blank">Oscar Pistorius’s running blades</a> - it uses 3d printed carbon fiber, and would bend as the user pressed into it while 'toeing-off', storing energy as it bended, and releasing it after a certain point, essentially the same motion as a normal ankle/foot movement, in a simple, reliable package. In robotics, this is known as an <a href="http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/underactuated.html" target="_blank">underactuated joint</a>.</h6>
<a href="/assets/motoradsc.png" target="blank">![](/assets/motoradsc.png)</a>
<h6>Embedded 3D printing allowed for otherwise impossible motor designs and specs: this motor has just three components - the 3d printed chassis, with the stator (the metal 'core') and bearing embedded during printing. It's 5 inches in diameter, weighed about a pound, and would fit comfortably in the palm of your hand. The hip and knee both used this motor without compromise.</h6>
<a href="/assets/yellowmotorcrop.jpg" target="blank">![](/assets/yellowmotorcrop.jpg)</a>
<h6>The motor in use. This hip assembly was the final revision from the V12 series (the assemblies below show earlier, less robust designs). It featured a waterproof rangefinder (the black cylinder), a toolless, yet reliable hip-knee connection (a real challenge, believe it or not), weighed approximately 2.5 pounds, and would cost ~$250. The chassis consisted entirely of 3D printed carbon fiber. The channels on the rubber pad are for routing cables from the lower leg assembly upwards.</h6>
<a href="/assets/crop5.5test.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/crop5.5test.jpg)</a>
<h6>The monolith approach was superseded by a four-part butterfly assembly. This early design shows only the central hub, which would contain critical electronics and sensors. The upper restraints prevented the user from leaning too far forward, but wouldn’t touch the user otherwise.</h6>
<a href="/assets/finale.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/finale.jpg)</a>
<h6>The final V12 design. The ‘butterfly’ assembly restored Atlas's center of mass to the 'goldilocks region', and drastically improved ergonomics (although it was still ergonomically untenable, it was an improvement). V12 weighed 25 pounds ( no weight would rest on the user - it would all transfer into the ground), had ~900 watts of power, and probably would’ve provided a six-hour endurance.</h6>
<a href="assets/psusnapcrop.PNG" target="_blank">![](/assets/psusnapcrop.PNG)</a>
<h6>The butterfly utilized a hybrid assembly – a 3d printed fiberglass chassis, with aluminum reinforcement inserts – to minimize costs and weight. The entire assembly weighed 8.5 pounds, and would’ve cost ~$2,500 – roughly a third of the entire exoskeleton cost. Later revisions would've hopefully improved ergonomics and cost. This screencap shows the unfinished assembly in CAD.</h6>
<a href="/assets/finale.5.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/finale.5.jpg)</a>
<h6>V12 pushed 3D printing, motor design, and construction methodology to their max: a user probably could’ve donned the entire system alone, in their wheelchair, in less than five minutes, and then live freely, untethered, for hours. But, ultimately, after a month or two of debate, I killed Atlas: exoskeletons must be as fluid and compliant as the human body, but Atlas was unavoidably rigid and engineered. So V12 was the final ‘Atlas’, and V13 was born in March, 2016, to another name: Awstrol.</h6>

<h6>One of the hardest aspects of this project for me has been how unshareable it is - beyond being an independent project, most people don't know what an exoskeleton is. And while I can share my renders, it's almost impossible to show you what my software looks like (can you visualize, for example, what a sensorless motor positioning system, or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter#Unscented_Kalman_filter" target="_blank">unscented Kalman filter</a>, looks like? I can't either.) These visualizations are probably the only 'programs' of mine I can show you - it's a Matlab program that maps a person’s kinematic motion and center of mass. It's important because it shows us how humans balance: if the center of mass extends beyond the hatched lines while near stationary, the ballerina (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wolPuHKrX9o&feature=youtu.be&t=36m50s" target="_blank">Mykayla Skinner</a>) will waiver, and fall after a certain displacement. You can use this analysis with any physical activity, but Olympians provide a fun example.</h6>

<h6>My theory is, that with enough video samples, you can 'train' a computer to walk and balance dynamically in chaotic environments, like humans do - this is called 'deep-learning' (<a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2016/03/deep-learning-for-robots-learning-from.html" target="_blank">read more here.</a>) Instead of 'building' our own realistic gait algorithm, which is probably impossible (given the lack of progress over the past decade...), you could instead train neural networks with many different body types using this analysis, and provide users quasi-personalized and adaptable gaits. The network would continue to learn and mature throughout operation with the user.</h6>

<h6>In essence, the machine and human will become indistinguishable. The potential is huge - think AI cars. This fusion of biology and purposeful design is what I mean when I say an exoskeleton must be human: if users live and move like normal people, they become normal - not paralyzed or disabled or unlucky. This is essentially the direction Awstrol has been heading - it's a totally different animal, and paralysis is the smallest thing it might solve. Read on for more about Awstrol.
