<h6>While metals are great, they're actually a poor choice for exoskeletons. I experimented with designs using <a href="https://markforged.com/" target="_blank">3d printed carbon fiber</a> as the primary material, and metals in areas where 3d printing wasn't feasible - components under constant and high strains, or  that needed very high tolerances, or were too large to print. In this render, you can see an exploded view of a brushless dc hub motor. The top clamshell is magnesium, while the rest of the chassis would use 3d printed carbon fiber.</h6>
<a href="/assets/legcomp.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/legcomp.jpg)</a>
<h6>The new motor approach was essentially inverting the layout of the old design. This 'hub' type motor could be smaller (5 in. diameter instead of 6), lighter (2 pounds versus 3), and stronger. It took a while for the design to mature into a robust form, which you'll see below.</h6>
<a href="/assets/legcomp1.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/legcomp1.jpg)</a>
<h6>The primary differences are quite apparent. Everything in black is 3d printed carbon fiber, and the gold is magnesium. The new construction method was cheaper and ergonomically superior, although probably not as robust. It took along time to reach a design that was adequately robust, while retaining all the advantages of this new design architecture.</h6>

<h6>The new, inverted motor architecture was also far slimmer by virtue that the entire outer shell rotated, instead of an inner spoke which would have to project above the motor. Another advantage of 3D printing was that you could embed components within the chassis - instead of using screws and bolts. This allowed for simpler, unibody assemblies that were inherently superior to past methods.</h6>

<h6>Version 10 kept the familiar power supply monolith and pelvis structure. It did introduce a new approach to the foot piece, however. The past designs had all been inadequate for too many reasons to explain succinctly, and this new approach put the foot piece inside the users shoe instead. V10's experimental ankle/foot design didn't work very well though, and was fixed later.</h6>
<a href="/assets/v5.59.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/v5.59.jpg)</a>
<h6>The pelvis used to involve 20 unique components. 3D printing allowed the main structure to exist as a single piece instead. Note, the internals of the pelvis are absent. </h6>
<a href="/assets/v5.62.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/v5.62.jpg)</a>
<h6>The monolith had a battery pack design similar to a tesla - lots of small, cylindrical cells wired together. The total power of this pack was ~1200 watts - future designs sought to avoid the safety danger that one giant lithium battery grenade poses (although it was also an ergonomic priority.)</h6>
<a href="/assets/untitled.92.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/untitled.92.jpg)</a>
<h6>Version 11 focused on improving user usability - the two primary changes were the additions of ultrasonic rangefinders and a passive flexure joint foot. Ultrasonic rangefinders are similar to laser rangefinders, except they bounce sound off of objects instead of light. By placing the rangefinders on the hip joint and lower ankle, you can produce a wireframe map of the forward environement, in real time. With proper software, the user-machine relationship would parallel a driver and an autonomous car.</h6>

<h6>The foot was based on a similar principle to Oscar Pistorious's running blades - the carbon fiber foot would bend as the user 'toed-off', storing energy as it bended, and releasing it after a certain point, essentially the same motion as a normal ankle/foot movement, in a simple, reliable package.</h6>

<h6>A matured hip assembly, from Version 12. This featured a waterproof distance sensor (the large black cylinder), enhanced joint sizing mechanism, and a more efficient motor design. The whole assembly weighed approximately 2 pounds, and the motor would fit in the palm of your hand. The channels on the rubber pad are for routing cables from the lower leg assembly upwards.</h6>
