I will try and add a short personal bio shortly, in the mean time here is <a href="assets/rbmresume.pdf" target="_blank">my resume</a>, and a brief disclaimer regarding this website and material herein presented.

This website was designed from scratch in Jekyll, using Github Pages. All renders were done in Keyshot 5; all CAD designs were done in Solidworks 2014 and 2016; all simulation studies and optimization design studies were performed in <a href="https://www.solidworks.com/sw/products/simulation/finite-element-analysis.htm" target="_blank">Solidworks Simulation</a>, <a href="https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/products/tecnomatix/manufacturing-simulation/human-ergonomics/index.shtml" target="_blank">NX Human Simulation and Ergonomics</a>, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/" target="_blank">Matlab</a>, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink/" target="_blank">Simulink</a>, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink/" target="_blank">Simulink</a>, <a href="http://www.ni.com/labview/" target="_blank">NI Labview</a>, <a href="http://www.ansys.com/products/platform" target="_blank">ANSYS Platform</a>, or <a href="http://www.ansys.com/products/structures" target="_blank">ANSYS Structures</a>, unless otherwise noted; all designs, software, and presented material is of my own efforts, and no other persons (unless otherwise noted.) 

Fun facts:
<ul>
<li>Total money invested: $120</li> 
  <ul><li>I tried building an arduino smartwatch but stopped after the apple watch came out. Journal articles and software have been free courtesy   of school licenses or using friends @.edu for student deals.</li></ul>
<li>Estimated time invested (hours): >4500</li> 
  <ul><li>4500hr/3yrâ‰…4hrs/day, which may seem high, given I have a mostly normal high school schedule, but if you knew my sleep schedule and my daydream habits, you might instead ask why is that number so low.</li></ul>
<li>Total people 'interviewed': >300</li>
 <ul><li>Mostly conducted over internet forums (e.g., reddit), about one person/week, lasting generally several hours over multiple sessions. For privacy reasons, I will not be sharing any specific details/data about this group.</li></ul>
<li>Number of 'restarts': 13</li>
<li>Number of completed renders: ~250</li>
<li>Average render complete time (hours): 18</li>
  <ul><li>If you look closely, you'll see these renders are incredibly high res. This correlates with extremely long render times.</li> 
<li>Longest render time (weeks): 2.7 weeks</li></ul>
 <ul><li>I tried to render the first 5 generations in one frame, at a remarkable 16k resolution (15,360x8640 pixels.) It reached 50% complete before the power went out during a storm, and that was that.</li></ul>
<li>Most difficult part of this project: starting</li>
<li>Number of people I've spoken to about this in person: ~30</li>
  <ul><li>The number is 10, if you ignore the presentation I gave at <a href="http://worldperspectivesprogram.org/symposium"   target="_blank">school</a>.</li></ul>
</ul>
