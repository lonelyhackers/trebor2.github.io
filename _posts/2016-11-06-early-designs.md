# The First 18 Months 
<a href="/assets/progenitor.png" target="_blank">![](/assets/progenitor.png)</a>
<h6>This was my first 'digital' drawing of Atlas, from early 2014, done in Microsoft paint. This design approach guided the first 18 months of the project. </h6>
<a href="/assets/cadv1.PNG" target="_blank">![](/assets/cadv1.PNG)
<h6>I taught myself how to use an engineering program called Solidworks, to design the components and assemblies in each exoskeleton. Learning Solidworks was like teaching myself how to sculpt marble with a toothbrush: difficult, but, with time, possible. This was my first assembled exoskeleton, although the power supply hasn't been designed yet.</h6>
<a href="/assets/xray.PNG" target="_blank">![](/assets/xray.PNG)
<h6>This is an x-ray view of the same assembly. Assemblies combine many individual subcomponents - like screws or chassis panels - in a virtual space, where you can test and simulate the overall design. I design everything except the nuts, bolts, and bearings.</h6>
<a href="/assets/Atlas%20render.52.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/Atlas%20render.52.jpg)
<h6>This is a render - I export the assemblies into a program called Keyshot, which can produce simulated pictures, like this one. For scale, the hip motors are 8 inches in diameter, the knee motors, 6 inches, and the feet, a size 11 mens. Velcro straps would wrap around the users thigh, calf, and feet. You can sort-of make out the locations for them to pass through.</h6>
<a href="/assets/backplategn.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/backplategn.jpg)
<h6>This render is an exploded view of Atlas's pelvis - the central joint between the legs, and power/computing unit. For scale, it's roughly 2.5 inches tall. You can make out a top and bottom motor inside the pelvis - these allow the legs to rotate, and control the pelvic width to match the users.</h6>
<a href="/assets/Atlas%20render%203.68.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/Atlas%20render%203.68.jpg)
<h6>Atlas V1 with an attached power supply. Just the chassis (i.e., no batteries, wiring, etc) weighed approximately 30 pounds, consisted of roughly 400 machined aluminum components, and would've cost roughly $30,000 to make - for context, current exoskeletons start at $75,000. </h6>
<a href="/assets/gennoneeht.png" target="_blank">![](/assets/gennoneeht.png)
<h6>But, if Atlas V1 had been prototyped, it would bear more resemblence to an overpriced torture machine than to a functioning exoskeleton. I was learning quickly though. </h6>
<a href="/assets/v3.11.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/v3.11.jpg)
<h6>Version 3, for example, had a flexible ankle joint, instead of a rigid one - flat-footed walking is generally terrible. This brings up an obvious, but easily overlooked, notion: to be useful, an exoskeleton has to be as 'human-like' as possible.</h6>
<a href="/assets/v3.13.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/v3.13.jpg)
<h6>I was starting to realize the importance of compliant and flexible design by V3. I added gel-pads on contact-surfaces for safety/comfort, and a slightly curved pelvis/powersupply. At the time, that level of accomadation seemed revolutionary to me. But I didn't let the advances distract me for long - I'd just discovered the magical power of ergonomic design</h6>
<a href="/assets/v3.14.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/v3.14.jpg)
<h6>Meanwhile, I was still figuring out how to integrate useful things, like turning, effectively. I spent a month developing the small motors connecting the hip motors to the pelvis - each is about 1.5 inches in diameter and height, which is tiny (I created a Matlab program to derive the optimal low volume, power dense motor, which is non-trivial). They're similar to quadcopter motors, but about 20x more expensive (~$5-700.)</h6>
<a href="/assets/v3.15.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/v3.15.jpg)
<h6>Impraticality was a dominant theme for most of this project. For example, V3 could fit Shaq - who is seven feet tall - at maximum extension (although Shaq weighs ~350 pounds, and the upper weight limit for early revisions was roughly 250lbs.) If he was in this render, everything above midchest would be out of the image. Like a child learning to draw, I had no concept of proportions, and everything seemed like a masterpiece.</h6>
<a href="/assets/v3.17.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/v3.17.jpg)
<h6>I spent another year improvising with new ideas, discovering flaws, retrying, and searching for something worth pursuing in that chaos, until my vision and understanding became more focsused and feasible. I designed each new exoskeleton from scratch - roughly 75-80 different exoskeletons, in the first 18 months. Version 8, above, was the last from this period.</h6>
<a href="/assets/v4.43.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/v4.43.jpg)
<h6>I wasn't just creating new 'things', I was inventing entirely new ways of doing so: I iterated on how I understood 'Exoskeletons', rather than just improving old designs. V8 was probably the first generation that would've worked, well - fully built, it would've weighed 27 pounds, cost ~$8,000 to build, and had an endurance of ~8 hours. On paper, it was at least equivalent to current exoskeletons, but lighter and cheaper.</h6>
<a href="/assets/v4.45.jpg" target="_blank">![](/assets/v4.45.jpg)
<h6>The advances came from a blend of different materials for a refined, hybrid construction, and improved understanding of</h6>
