# The First 18 Months 
![](/assets/progenitor.png)
<h6>This was my first 'digital' drawing of Atlas, from early 2014, done in Microsoft paint. This design approach guided the first 18 months of the project. </h6>

<h6>I taught myself how to use an engineering program called Solidworks, to design the components and assemblies in each exoskeleton. Learning Solidworks was like teaching myself how to sculpt marble with a toothbrush: difficult, but, with time, possible. This was my first assembled exoskeleton, although the power supply hasn't been designed yet.</h6>

<h6>This is an x-ray view of the same assembly. Assemblies combine many individual subcomponents - like screws or chassis panels - in a virtual space, where you can test and simulate the overall design. I design everything except the nuts, bolts, and bearings.</h6>

<h6>This is a render - I export the assemblies into a program called Keyshot, which can produce simulated pictures, like this one. For scale, the hip motors are 8 inches in diameter, the knee motors, 6 inches, and the feet, a size 11 mens. Velcro straps would wrap around the users thigh, calf, and feet. You can sort-of make out the locations for them to pass through.</h6>

<h6>This render is an exploded view of Atlas's pelvis - the central joint between the legs, and power/computing unit. For scale, it's roughly 2.5 inches tall. You can make out a top and bottom motor inside the pelvis - these allow the legs to rotate, and control the pelvic width to match the users.</h6>

<h6>Atlas V1 with an attached power supply. Just the chassis (i.e., no batteries, wiring, etc) weighed approximately 30 pounds, consisted of roughly 400 machined aluminum components, and would've cost roughly $30,000 to make - for context, current exoskeletons start at $75,000. </h6>

<h6>But, if Atlas V1 had been prototyped, it would bear more resemblence to an overpriced torture machine than to a functioning exoskeleton. I was learning quickly though. </h6>

<h6>Version 3, for example, had a flexible ankle joint, instead of a rigid one - flat-footed walking is generally terrible. This brings up an obvious, but easily overlooked, notion: to be useful, an exoskeleton has to be as 'human-like' as possible.</h6>
![](/assets/v3.13.jpg)
<h6>I was starting to realize the importance of compliant and flexible design by V3. I added gel-pads on contact-surfaces for safety/comfort, and a slightly curved pelvis/powersupply. </h6>
![](/assets/v3.14.jpg)
<h6>You can make out four smaller motors connecting the hip motors to the pelvis (these rotated the legs). Each is about 1 inch in diameter and height - tiny. I used Matlab to derive the optimal motor architechure for the requirements, which took roughly a month or two. They're similar to quadcopter motors, but about 20x more expensive (~$500) </h6>

<h6>Impraticality was a dominant theme for most of this project. For example, this revision could fit Shaq - who is seven feet tall - at maximum extension.</h6>
![](/assets/v3.17.jpg)
<h6>So I spent the next year improving the ergonomics, and learned how to actually design mechanically sound components</h6>

<h6>Iterating on what has already been created is a trap of limited imagination though. </h6>
