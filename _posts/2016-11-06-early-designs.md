<h6>This was the first 'digital' drawing of Atlas, from early 2014. This was done in Microsoft paint. The design doctrine was centered around this 'rendition' for about a year. </h6>

<h6>Designing Atlas was more difficult. I use a program called Solidworks to design the components and assemblies in each exoskeleton. This was my first assembled exoskeleton, although the power supply hasn't been designed yet.</h6>

<h6>This is an x-ray view of the same assembly. Assemblies combine many individual subcomponents - like screws or chassis panels - in a virtual space, where you can test and simulate the overall design.</h6>

<h6>This is a render - I export the assemblies into a program called Keyshot, which can produce simulated pictures, like this one.</h6>

<h6>This render is an exploded view of Atlas's pelvis - the central joint between the legs, and power/computing unit. You can make out a top and bottom motor inside the pelvis - these allow the legs to rotate, and control the pelvic width to match the users. </h6>

<h6>Atlas V1 with an attached power supply. This chassis weighed approximately 30 pounds, consisted of roughly 400 machined aluminum components, and would've cost roughly $30,000 to make - for context, current exoskeletons retail at roughly $70,000. </h6>

<h6>Although if Atlas V1 was prototyped, it would bear more resemblence to a glorified torture machine than a functioning exoskeletons. I was learning quickly though. </h6>

<h6>Version 3, for example, had a passively controlled ankle, instead of a rigid one. Not seen, straps that would secure the users shoe to the adjustable shoe-bed. </h6>
