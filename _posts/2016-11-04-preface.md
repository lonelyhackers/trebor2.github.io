# Preface

Awstrol (pronounced â€œawe-stroll) is an homage honoring Australopithecus, our oldest bipedal ancestor. My projects name has changed through the years, and so too has its story, ambitions, and nature.
Yet it is the precious few things that have endured without change that matter most, and deserve to be honored. Their stories mean more, are worth hearing, and demand our attention. 
I am, of course, 
the Person who is paralyzed; is old; 


Their story is not mine to tell
