Hi. This section is supposed to be filled with lots of interesting stuff about my past year of work. I promise that eventually this section will be updated with the full set of renders, explanations, and ideas, but it's going to be some time before I can present the material in a way that protects my IP properly. I'll probably update this section piecemeal, starting on April 1st, through the end of March. I also intend to finish a site redesign around that time, moving from a very linear design to something more standard and friendly. 

Thank you so much for your patience and understanding!

Robbie
