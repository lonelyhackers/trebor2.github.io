This will host renders not previously shown - approximately 70 - in a slightly chronological order. I'm currently working on a format that won't crash your web browser in the process of loading this page...
<ul>
  {% for image in page.images %}
    <a href="{{ image.image_path }}" target="_blank"><img src= "{{ image.image_path }}"></a>
    <br>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
