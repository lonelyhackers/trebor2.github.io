This will host renders not previously shown - approximately 70 - in a slightly chronological order. This is a huge amount for one page, and I apologize (this was the least ugly method of doing this...) I recommend skipping this section unless you have unlimited free time...
<ul>
  {% for image in page.images %}
    <a href="{{ image.image_path }}" target="_blank"><img src= "{{ image.image_path }}"></a>
    <br>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
