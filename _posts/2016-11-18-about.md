I will try and add a short personal bio shortly, in the mean time here is <a href="assets/rbmresume.pdf" target="_blank">my resume</a>, and a brief disclaimer regarding this website and material herein presented, and some fun facts.

<ul>
Fun facts:
<li>Total money invested: $0</li> 
  <r7>Journal articles and software have been free courtesy of school or borrowing licenses from friends.</r7>
<li>Estimated time invested (hours): >4500</li> 
  <r7>4500hr/3yrâ‰…4hrs/day, which may seem high, given I have a mostly normal high school schedule, but if you knew my sleep schedule and my daydream habits, you might instead ask why is that number so low.</r7>
<li>Total interviews conducted: >300</li>
 <r7>Mostly conducted over online forums, about one person/week, generally lasting several hours over multiple sessions.</r7>
<li>Number of project 'restarts': 13</li>
<li>Average render time (hours): 18</li>
  <r7>If you look closely, you'll see these renders are incredibly high res. This correlates with extremely long render times.</r7>
<li>Longest render time (weeks): 2.7 weeks</li>
 <r7>I tried to render the first 5 generations together, at 16k resolution (15,360x8640 pixels.) It reached 50% complete before the power went out during a storm, and that was that.</r7>
<li>Largest simulation study (gb): 300</li>
<li>Number of people I've spoken to about this in person: ~30</li>
  <r7>The number is 10, if you ignore the presentation I gave at <a href="http://worldperspectivesprogram.org/symposium"   target="_blank">school</a>.</r7>
</ul>

Disclaimers:
This website was designed from scratch in Jekyll, using Github Pages. All renders were done in Keyshot 5; all CAD designs were done in Solidworks 2014 and 2016; all simulation studies and optimization design studies were performed in <a href="https://www.solidworks.com/sw/products/simulation/finite-element-analysis.htm" target="_blank">Solidworks Simulation</a>, <a href="https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/products/tecnomatix/manufacturing-simulation/human-ergonomics/index.shtml" target="_blank">NX Human Simulation and Ergonomics</a>, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/" target="_blank">Matlab</a>, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink/" target="_blank">Simulink</a>, <a href="http://www.ni.com/labview/" target="_blank">NI Labview</a>, <a href="http://www.ansys.com/products/platform" target="_blank">ANSYS Platform</a>, or <a href="http://www.ansys.com/products/structures" target="_blank">ANSYS Structures</a>, unless otherwise noted; all designs, software, and presented materials are of my own effort, and no other persons (unless otherwise noted.)

All claims have not been tested beyond simulations, and should thus be taken with a grain of salt.
