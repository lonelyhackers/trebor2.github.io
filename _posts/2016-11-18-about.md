Hey there.

I’m Robert. I’m 18, and a senior in high school.

If you've made it this far, I'd like to thank you for visiting, and hope you enjoyed the site. 

If you’d like to talk to me about this project, some other projects, or what’s on my opportunity radar, contact me. 
<br>
Other Projects of Mine:

- Public Art; or, how to be the worlds greatest art thief, February 2016 - Present
- Control theory for brushless motors, October 2013 - May 2015
- More to come soon

Common Questions:

<i>Have you considered a science fair?</i>

> Yes, but I’ve never participated in any. Science fairs complicate/endanger the patent process tremendously, and I wouldn’t want to present a portion of this, and not the entire thing. Also, this isn’t really a ‘science’ project. It’s a feasibility study first, design challenge second, sociology project third. I don’t think it belongs near a fair. 

<i>Can you share CAD files, the source code for the video demonstration, or other mentions of custom software?</i>

> Not currently. I’m fine sharing renders and some details, but this website is really the tip of the ice-berg in terms of the work I’ve done, and research produced. What you see is everything I decided wouldn’t endanger future IP. If I could provide source code, I would. 

<i>How do you calculate pricing for prototypes?</i>

> In the case of 3D printed components, the estimates are material cost, so the estimate is very accurate. For machined components, I use <a href="https://www.protolabs.com/" target="_blank">protolabs</a> or similar prototyping facilities. For more complex components, like custom motor stators or gel pads, I contact actual manufacturers, so somewhat accurate. Other components, like electronics or bearings, I use companies like digi-key or McMaster-Carr. This method does ignore the time cost on my behalf, but I've never been in this for the money, so my time is free.

This website was designed from scratch in Jekyll, using Github Pages. All renders were done in Keyshot 5; all CAD designs were done in Solidworks 2014 and 2016; all simulation studies and optimization design studies were performed in <a href="https://www.solidworks.com/sw/products/simulation/finite-element-analysis.htm" target="_blank">Solidworks Simulation</a>, <a href="https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/products/tecnomatix/manufacturing-simulation/human-ergonomics/index.shtml" target="_blank">NX Human Simulation and Ergonomics</a>, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/" target="_blank">Matlab</a>, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink/" target="_blank">Simulink</a>, <a href="http://www.ni.com/labview/" target="_blank">NI Labview</a>, <a href="http://www.ansys.com/products/platform" target="_blank">ANSYS Platform</a>, or <a href="http://www.ansys.com/products/structures" target="_blank">ANSYS Structures</a>, <a href="http://www.ansys.com/products/electronics/ansys-maxwell" target="_blank">ANSYS Maxwell</a>, or <a href="http://www.ansys.com/Products/Fluids/ANSYS-Fluent" target="_blank">ANSYS Fluent</a>, unless otherwise noted; all designs, software, and presented materials are of my own effort, and no other persons (unless otherwise noted.) 

All claims have not been tested beyond simulations, and should thus be taken with grains of salt.
