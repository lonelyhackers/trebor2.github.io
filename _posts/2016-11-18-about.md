Hey there. 	
I’m Robert – an American problem solver. I’m 18, and a senior in high school.  

I like analyzing logic puzzles, listening to other people’s stories, climbing, and art, among other things. My favorite color is blue (though I’m considering giving yellow a try), and I think the most challenging part of life is doing something that means something.

My primary goal in life is to experience as many meaningful opportunities as I can – common or rare, dangerous or boring – and share those experiences with the world. This project is just one such example, and even this won’t be finished till people see exoskeletons the same way they do computers (personal, and empowering). 

If you’d like to talk to me about this project, some other projects, or what’s on my opportunity radar, contact me. In the meantime, here is my <a href="assets/rbmresume.pdf" target="_blank">CV (PDF)</a>, a brief FAQ, and some fun facts about the project.

<br>

<i>I’d like to collaborate with you, or work with you. Can we?</i>

> Yes! Here’s a <a href="/assets/RFCollab.pdf">request for collaborators (PDF)</a> that explains what technical skills I’m on the lookout for.

<i>Have you considered a science fair?</i>

> Yes, but I’ve never participated in any. Science fairs complicate/endanger the patent process tremendously, and I wouldn’t want to present a portion of this, and not the entire thing. Also, this isn’t really a ‘science’ project. It’s a feasibility study first, design challenge second, sociology project third. I don’t think it belongs near a fair. 

<i>Can you share CAD files, the source code for the video demonstration, or other mentions of custom software?</i>

> Not currently. I’m fine sharing renders and some details, but this website is really the tip of the ice-berg in terms of the work I’ve done, and research produced. What you see is everything I decided wouldn’t endanger currently pending utility patent filings, or future patents I/Awstrol Inc. file. If I could provide source code, I would. 

<i>How do you calculate pricing for prototypes?</i>

> In the case of 3D printed components, the estimates are material cost, so the estimate is very accurate. For machined components, I use <a href="https://www.protolabs.com/" target="_blank">protolabs</a> or similar prototyping facilities. For more complex components, like custom motor stators or gel pads, I contact actual manufacturers, so somewhat accurate. Other components, like electronics or bearings, I use companies like digi-key or McMaster-Carr.

<ul>
Fun facts:
<li>Total money invested: $0</li> 
  <r7>Journal articles and software have been free courtesy of school or borrowing licenses from friends.</r7>
<li>Total interviews conducted: >300</li>
 <r7>Mostly conducted over online forums, about one person/week, generally lasting several hours over multiple sessions.</r7>
<li>Number of project 'restarts': 13</li>
<li>Average render time (hours): 18</li>
  <r7>If you look closely, you'll see these renders are incredibly high res. This correlates with extremely long render times.</r7>
<li>Longest render time (weeks): 2.7 weeks</li>
 <r7>I tried to render the first 5 generations together, at 16k resolution (15,360x8640 pixels.) It reached 50% complete before the power went out during a storm, and that was that.</r7>
<li>Largest simulation study (gb): 300</li>
<li>Number of people I've spoken to about this in person: ~30</li>
  <r7>The number is 10, if you ignore the presentation I gave at <a href="http://worldperspectivesprogram.org/symposium"   target="_blank">school</a>.</r7>
</ul>

Disclaimers:
This website was designed from scratch in Jekyll, using Github Pages. All renders were done in Keyshot 5; all CAD designs were done in Solidworks 2014 and 2016; all simulation studies and optimization design studies were performed in <a href="https://www.solidworks.com/sw/products/simulation/finite-element-analysis.htm" target="_blank">Solidworks Simulation</a>, <a href="https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/products/tecnomatix/manufacturing-simulation/human-ergonomics/index.shtml" target="_blank">NX Human Simulation and Ergonomics</a>, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/" target="_blank">Matlab</a>, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink/" target="_blank">Simulink</a>, <a href="http://www.ni.com/labview/" target="_blank">NI Labview</a>, <a href="http://www.ansys.com/products/platform" target="_blank">ANSYS Platform</a>, or <a href="http://www.ansys.com/products/structures" target="_blank">ANSYS Structures</a>, unless otherwise noted; all designs, software, and presented materials are of my own effort, and no other persons (unless otherwise noted.)

All claims have not been tested beyond simulations, and should thus be taken with a grain of salt.
