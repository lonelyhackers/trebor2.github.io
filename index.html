An exoskeleton is a wearable robot, in this case, for paralyzed patients. Their purpose is to restore mobility. <br>In essence, an exoskeleton gives users more control, and more choice, in life.<br>
This portfolio should take about 8 minutes to read. There is a preface, two galleries with captions, and a discussion. If you’re limited on time, browse through some of the photos. No one’s ever regretted it.<br><br>
