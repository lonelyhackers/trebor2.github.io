<p style="margin-top: 25vh; text-align: center; line-height: 2;">Hi.<br>This is a website about exoskeletons - specifically, my exoskeletons. An exoskeleton is a wearable robot, in this case, for paralyzed patients. Their purpose is to restore mobility. <br>In essence, an exoskeleton gives users more control, and more choice, in life.<br><br>
This portfolio should take about 8 minutes to read. Their is a preface, two photo galleries with captions, and a discussion. If you’re limited on time, browse through some of the photos. No one’s ever regretted it.<br><br>
