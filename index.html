<p style="margin-top: 25vh; text-align: center">I’ve been listening to soul since I was ten or twelve years old. Music is a very strong influence in my work: the chords, the rhythm, the stories and melody - the rugged power of soul is helpful when I design. I wanted to be a musician, but I couldn’t play the instruments very well, so I became a designer. Designing anything is just like playing music: first I play the theme, then I improvise, then there is a conclusion, of a kind.
